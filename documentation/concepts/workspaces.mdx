## What is a Workspace?

A workspace in Auk is an isolated environment for organizing your API collections, environments, and settings. Each workspace operates independently with its own local storage and optional Git repository.

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Data Isolation" icon="shield">
    Each workspace has completely separate data - collections, environments, and history never mix between workspaces
  </Card>

  <Card title="Independent Git" icon="code-branch">
    Configure different Git repositories for each workspace, enabling separate version control strategies
  </Card>

  <Card title="Custom Settings" icon="gear">
    Each workspace can have its own proxy settings, interceptor configuration, and preferences
  </Card>

  <Card title="Quick Switching" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Instantly switch between workspaces without losing context or closing the application
  </Card>

## Use Cases

### Separate Work and Personal Projects

```
~/auk-workspaces/
├── work/
│   ├── collections/
│   ├── environments/
│   └── .git/              # Synced to company Git server
└── personal/
    ├── collections/
    ├── environments/
    └── .git/              # Synced to personal GitHub
```

### Multi-Client Management

```
~/auk-workspaces/
├── client-acme/
│   └── .git/              # Client A's private repo
├── client-globex/
│   └── .git/              # Client B's private repo
└── internal/
    └── .git/              # Company internal repo
```

### Project-Based Organization

```
~/auk-workspaces/
├── project-alpha/
├── project-beta/
└── project-gamma/
```

## Workspace Structure

Each workspace contains:

```
workspace-name/
├── collections/           # API collections
│   ├── collection-1.json
│   └── collection-2.json
├── environments/          # Environment variables
│   ├── dev.json
│   ├── staging.json
│   └── production.json
├── history/              # Request history
│   └── history.json
├── settings.json         # Workspace settings
└── .git/                # Optional Git repository
```

## Workspace Settings

Each workspace can be configured with:

- **Name and Description** - Identify the workspace purpose
- **Storage Location** - Local file system path
- **Git Repository** - Remote repository URL (optional)
- **Sync Settings** - Auto-sync interval and conflict resolution strategy
- **Default Environment** - Environment to load on startup
- **Proxy Configuration** - HTTP/HTTPS proxy settings
- **Interceptor Mode** - System proxy/Agent or none

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Name workspaces clearly to reflect their purpose:
    - ✅ `acme-corp-apis`
    - ✅ `personal-projects`
    - ❌ `workspace-1`
    - ❌ `test`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organize by Context">
    Group related APIs together:
    - By client/customer
    - By project
    - By environment (dev/staging/prod)
    - By team
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enable Git Sync for Teams">
    For collaborative work, always configure Git sync to ensure team members stay in sync
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Personal Data Separate">
    Use separate workspaces for work and personal projects to maintain clear boundaries
  </Accordion>
