## Differences from Auk

Auk is based on Auk with the following key differences:

| Aspect | Auk | Auk |
|--------|------------|-----|
| **Storage** | Cloud Database | Local File System |
| **Collaboration** | Cloud Workspace | Git Repository |
| **Authentication** | OAuth Login | No Login Required |
| **Backend** | PostgreSQL + GraphQL | No Backend |
| **Deployment** | Web + Self-host | Desktop App Only |
| **Offline** | Limited | Full Support |
| **Data Control** | Cloud Provider | Full User Control |

## Use Cases

### Individual Developers

- Manage API collections locally without registration
- Full data control and privacy protection
- Work offline without network dependency

### Team Collaboration

- Share API collections via Git repositories
- Use familiar Git workflows
- Code review and version control

### Enterprise Intranet

- Deploy in intranet environment without external access
- Use internal Git services (GitLab, Gitea, etc.)
- Data stays within intranet, secure and controlled

### Sensitive Projects

- Data stored locally or on private servers
- Full control over data access permissions
