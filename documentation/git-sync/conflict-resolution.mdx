## Understanding Conflicts

Conflicts occur when multiple team members modify the same part of a collection or environment simultaneously.

## When Conflicts Happen

## Conflict Detection

Auk detects conflicts during sync:

```
Sync Process:
1. Commit local changes ✓
2. Pull remote changes ✓
3. Merge changes... ⚠️  Conflict detected!

   Conflicts in:
   - collections/user-api.json
   - environments/development.json
```

### Conflict Notification

When conflicts are detected:

1. **Sync Pauses** - Auto-sync stops
2. **Notification** - Desktop notification appears
3. **Status Indicator** - Shows conflict warning
4. **Conflict Panel** - Opens automatically

## Conflict Resolution UI

Auk provides a visual interface for resolving conflicts:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Conflict Resolution                                     │

```

## Resolution Strategies

### 1. Smart Merge (Recommended)

Automatically combines non-conflicting changes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze Changes">
    Auk analyzes both versions to identify conflicts
  </Step>

  <Step title="Auto-Merge Safe Changes">
    Non-conflicting changes are merged automatically:
    - New requests added by both sides
    - Different properties modified
    - Independent changes
  </Step>

  <Step title="Highlight Conflicts">
    Only true conflicts require manual resolution:
    - Same property changed differently
    - Conflicting deletions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Merge">
    Merged result is saved and committed
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**

```json
// Your changes: Added "email" field
{
  "name": "required",
  "email": "required"
}

// Remote changes: Added "phone" field
{
  "name": "required",
  "phone": "optional"
}

// Smart merge result: Both fields included
{
  "name": "required",
  "email": "required",
  "phone": "optional"
}
```

### 2. Keep Your Changes

Use your local version, discarding remote changes:

<Warning>
  This will overwrite team members' changes. Use only when you're certain your version is correct.
</Warning>

**When to use:**
- You know remote changes are incorrect
- You've discussed with team and agreed
- Remote changes were accidental

### 3. Use Remote Changes

Accept remote version, discarding your local changes:

<Warning>
  This will discard your local changes. Ensure you don't need them before proceeding.
</Warning>

**When to use:**
- Remote changes are more up-to-date
- You want to start fresh with team's version
- Your local changes were experimental

### 4. Manual Edit

Manually edit the conflicting file:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open in Editor">
    Click "Edit Manually" to open the file
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Conflict Markers">
    Git adds conflict markers to the file:
    ```json
    {
      "endpoint": "/users",
    <<<<<<< HEAD (Your changes)
      "body": {
        "name": "required"
      }
    =======
      "body": {
        "username": "required"
      }
    >>>>>>> remote (Remote changes)
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resolve Conflicts">
    Edit the file to resolve conflicts:
    ```json
    {
      "endpoint": "/users",
      "body": {
        "username": "required",
        "name": "required"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark as Resolved">
    Save the file and mark conflict as resolved
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Conflict Types

### Collection Conflicts

**Scenario:** Two people modify the same collection

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Request Modified">
    **Conflict:**
    - Person A: Changed request method to PUT
    - Person B: Changed request endpoint

    **Resolution:**
    - Smart merge: Apply both changes
    - Result: PUT request with new endpoint
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Request Added">
    **Conflict:**
    - Person A: Added POST /users
    - Person B: Added POST /users (different body)

    **Resolution:**
    - Keep both requests
    - Rename one to avoid duplication
    - Or merge request bodies if compatible
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Request Deleted">
    **Conflict:**
    - Person A: Deleted GET /users
    - Person B: Modified GET /users

    **Resolution:**
    - Prompt user: Keep deletion or keep modification?
    - If kept: Use modified version
    - If deleted: Remove request
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Environment Conflicts

**Scenario:** Environment variables changed differently

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Variable Modified">
    **Conflict:**
    - Person A: `baseUrl = "http://localhost:3000"`
    - Person B: `baseUrl = "http://localhost:8080"`

    **Resolution:**
    - Prompt user to choose correct value
    - Or keep both in different environments
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Variable Added">
    **Conflict:**
    - Person A: Added `apiKey = "key1"`
    - Person B: Added `apiKey = "key2"`

    **Resolution:**
    - Choose which key to use
    - Or rename one variable
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Secret Variables">
    **Conflict:**
    - Person A: Changed secret value
    - Person B: Changed same secret

    **Resolution:**
    - Secrets should not be in Git
    - Use local-only environment files
    - Add to `.gitignore`
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Preventing Conflicts

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sync Frequently">
    Reduce conflict likelihood by syncing often:
    ```json
    {
      "git": {
        "autoSync": true,
        "syncInterval": 300  // 5 minutes
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communicate Changes">
    Coordinate with team before major changes:
    - Announce in team chat before editing
    - Use feature branches for large changes
    - Assign ownership of collections
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Divide Responsibilities">
    Organize collections by ownership:
    ```
    collections/
    ├── auth/           # Alice owns
    ├── users/          # Bob owns
    └── payments/       # Carol owns
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Feature Branches">
    Create branches for major changes:
    ```bash
    # Create feature branch
    git checkout -b feature/new-endpoints

    # Work on changes
    # Merge back when ready
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pull Before Push">
    Always pull latest changes before starting work:
    - Sync at start of day
    - Sync before making changes
    - Sync before switching tasks
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Workspace Organization

Structure workspaces to minimize conflicts:

```
Option 1: By Feature
├── workspace-auth/
├── workspace-payments/
└── workspace-users/

Option 2: By Environment
├── workspace-dev/
├── workspace-staging/
└── workspace-prod/

Option 3: By Team Member
├── workspace-alice/
├── workspace-bob/
└── workspace-shared/
```

## Advanced Scenarios

### Multiple Conflicts

When multiple files have conflicts:

1. **Resolve One by One** - Auk presents conflicts sequentially
2. **Batch Resolution** - Apply same strategy to all (if appropriate)
3. **Skip and Return** - Skip difficult conflicts, resolve easy ones first

### Recurring Conflicts

If same conflicts keep appearing:

1. **Identify Root Cause** - Why are same files conflicting?
2. **Reorganize** - Split collections or use branches
3. **Coordinate** - Establish team conventions
4. **Automate** - Use conflict resolution rules

### Complex Merges

For complex conflicts:

1. **Export Both Versions** - Save local and remote versions
2. **Manual Merge** - Use external diff tool
3. **Import Result** - Import merged version back
4. **Verify** - Test thoroughly before committing

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cannot resolve conflict">
    **Symptoms:** Resolution fails or creates errors

    **Solutions:**
    - Export both versions for manual review
    - Check JSON syntax is valid
    - Restore from backup if needed
    - Contact team to coordinate resolution
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conflict resolution UI not showing">
    **Symptoms:** Conflict detected but no UI appears

    **Solutions:**
    - Check notification settings
    - Manually open conflict panel
    - Review sync logs for details
    - Restart Auk if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Resolved conflict reappears">
    **Symptoms:** Same conflict appears after resolution

    **Solutions:**
    - Ensure resolution was committed
    - Check sync completed successfully
    - Verify remote has your changes
    - May need to force push (with caution)
