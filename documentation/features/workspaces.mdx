Workspaces in Auk are **local-first**. Each workspace lives on your machine (under the Auk data directory) and can optionally be linked to a Git repository for collaboration. There are no cloud accounts or user invitations; sharing happens through Git remotes.

## Create a workspace

1. Click the **"+"** icon in the workspace switcher.
2. Choose a workspace name and (optionally) pick a Git repo path.
3. Confirm to create. The workspace data is stored locally; no login required.

<Tip>Use separate workspaces for different clients or teams to keep collections and environments isolated.</Tip>

## Switch between workspaces

To switch between workspaces, click on the workspace switcher in the top right corner of the app and select the workspace you want to switch to.

## Link a workspace to Git

1. Open **Settings → Git Sync** inside the workspace.
2. Set the repository URL (GitHub/GitLab/self-hosted) and authentication method.
3. Commit and push collections/environments like regular files.

All workspace data is stored in a Git-friendly structure so you can review changes, open pull requests, and resolve conflicts using standard Git tools.

## Rename or delete a workspace

- **Rename**: Open **Workspace Settings → General** and edit the name.
- **Delete**: From the same settings page, choose **Delete workspace**. This removes the local copy; your Git remote (if any) stays intact.
