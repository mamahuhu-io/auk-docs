Auk helps you organize your API requests with collections. Collections are stored locally in your workspace and can be synced to Git for team collaboration and version control.

You can access collections by clicking the "**Collections**" icon in the sidebar.

## Creating a New Collection

To create a new collection:

1. Click the "**Add new**" button in the collections section
2. Enter the collection name
3. Optionally add a description
4. Click "**Create**"

You can also create sub-collections (folders) by clicking "**Add new**" within an existing collection.

<Tip>
  Use descriptive names like "User Management API" or "Payment Service" instead of generic names like "Collection 1".
</Tip>

## Save Requests to Collections

To add a request to your collection:

1. Configure your request (URL, method, headers, body, etc.)
2. Click the "**Save**" button
3. Select the collection and folder
4. Enter a request name
5. Click "**Save**"

**Save As:**
- Click the dropdown next to "Save" button
- Select "**Save as**" to save to a different location
- Useful for creating variations of requests

<Tip>
  Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd/Ctrl + S` to save the current request
</Tip>

## Organizing Collections

### Drag and Drop

Organize collections by dragging and dropping:

- Drag requests between folders
- Drag folders to reorder
- Drag folders into other folders to create hierarchy
- Drag requests to reorder within a folder

### Nested Structure

Create unlimited levels of organization:

```
User Management API
├── Authentication
│   ├── Login
│   ├── Logout
│   └── Refresh Token
├── Users
│   ├── Get User
│   ├── Create User
│   ├── Update User
│   └── Delete User
└── Permissions
    ├── Get Permissions
    └── Update Permissions
```

### Editing Collections

To edit a collection:

1. Right-click on the collection
2. Select "**Edit**"
3. Update name, description, or properties
4. Click "**Save**"

### Adding Requests

To add a new request to a collection:

1. Right-click on the collection or folder
2. Select "**New request**"
3. Configure the request
4. It will be automatically saved to that location

## Duplicating Collections

To duplicate a collection:

1. Right-click on the collection
2. Select "**Duplicate**"
3. A copy will be created with "- Copy" suffix
4. Rename as needed

**Use Cases:**
- Create variations for different environments
- Backup before major changes
- Share modified version with team

## Deleting Collections

To delete a collection:

1. Right-click on the collection
2. Select "**Delete**"
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  Deleted collections are moved to trash and can be restored within 30 days. After that, they are permanently deleted. If Git sync is enabled, you can restore from Git history.
</Warning>

## Exporting Collections

Export collections for backup or sharing:

### Export Formats

**Auk Format (JSON):**
- Native format
- Preserves all features
- Best for backup and sharing with Auk users

**Postman Format:**
- Compatible with Postman
- Good for sharing with Postman users
- Some Auk-specific features may not transfer

**OpenAPI Format:**
- Standard API specification
- Good for documentation
- Generates spec from requests

**cURL:**
- Export individual requests as cURL commands
- Good for command-line usage
- Easy to share single requests

### Export Steps

1. Right-click on collection
2. Select "**Export**"
3. Choose format
4. Select destination
5. Click "**Export**"

## Collection Properties

Collection properties apply to all requests within the collection.

### Authorization

Set default authorization for all requests:

- **None** - No authentication
- **Basic Auth** - Username and password
- **Bearer Token** - Token-based auth
- **OAuth 2.0** - OAuth flow
- **API Key** - API key in header or query
- **Digest Auth** - Digest authentication
- **Hawk** - Hawk authentication
- **AWS Signature** - AWS SigV4

**Inheritance:**
- Subfolders inherit parent authorization
- Individual requests can override
- Use "Inherit" to use parent settings

### Headers

Set default headers for all requests:

```
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
User-Agent: Auk/1.0
```

**Common Headers:**
- `Content-Type` - Request body format
- `Accept` - Response format
- `Authorization` - Auth token (if not using auth)
- `User-Agent` - Client identifier
- `X-API-Key` - API key

**Inheritance:**
- Subfolders inherit parent headers
- Individual requests can add or override
- Duplicate headers are merged

### Variables

Define collection-level variables:

```
baseUrl = https://api.example.com
apiVersion = v1
timeout = 30000
```

**Usage in Requests:**
```
URL: <<baseUrl>>/<<apiVersion>>/users
Timeout: <<timeout>>
```

**Scope:**
- Available to all requests in collection
- Can be overridden by environment variables
- Useful for collection-specific values

## Git Sync Integration

When Git sync is enabled, collections are automatically version controlled.

### Automatic Commits

Auk automatically commits collection changes:

```
Update users-api: Added new endpoint GET /users/:id
Update products-api: Modified request headers
Add new collection: Orders API
Delete collection: Legacy API
```

### Viewing History

View collection change history:

1. Right-click on collection
2. Select "**View History**"
3. See all commits affecting this collection
4. View diffs between versions
5. Restore previous versions if needed

### Conflict Resolution

If multiple team members edit the same collection:

1. Auk detects conflicts during sync
2. Shows conflict resolution dialog
3. Choose resolution strategy:
   - Keep local changes
   - Use remote changes
   - Manual merge
4. Resolve and sync

[Learn more about conflict resolution](/documentation/git-sync/conflict-resolution)

### Branching

Work on collections in branches:

1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes to collections
3. Push branch to remote
4. Create pull request
5. Merge after review

**Use Cases:**
- Experimental endpoints
- Major API changes
- Team feature development

## Collection Organization Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent names:

```
✅ Good:
- "User Management API"
- "Payment Service v2"
- "Internal Admin API"

❌ Bad:
- "Collection 1"
- "Test"
- "New Collection"
```

### Folder Structure

Organize by resource or feature:

**By Resource:**
```
API Collection
├── Users
├── Products
├── Orders
└── Payments
```

**By Feature:**
```
API Collection
├── Authentication
├── User Management
├── Shopping Cart
└── Checkout
```

**By Version:**
```
API Collection
├── v1
│   ├── Users
│   └── Products
└── v2
    ├── Users
    └── Products
```

### Documentation

Add descriptions to collections:

- Purpose of the API
- Base URL
- Authentication requirements
- Common parameters
- Rate limits
- Contact information

### Request Naming

Use descriptive request names:

```
✅ Good:
- "Get User by ID"
- "Create New Product"
- "Update Order Status"

❌ Bad:
- "Request 1"
- "Test"
- "GET"
```

## Advanced Features

### Collection Runner

Run all requests in a collection:

1. Right-click on collection
2. Select "**Run Collection**"
3. Configure run settings:
   - Environment
   - Iterations
   - Delay between requests
4. Click "**Run**"
5. View results

**Use Cases:**
- Integration testing
- Smoke testing
- Data seeding
- Batch operations

### Collection Variables

Use variables for dynamic values:

```javascript
// Pre-request script
const userId = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000);
pw.env.set("userId", userId);

// Request URL
<<baseUrl>>/users/<<userId>>
```

### Collection Scripts

Add scripts that run for all requests:

**Pre-request Script:**
```javascript
// Runs before each request in collection
const timestamp = Date.now();
pw.env.set("timestamp", timestamp);
```

**Test Script:**
```javascript
// Runs after each request in collection
pw.test("Status code is 200", () => {
  pw.expect(pw.response.status).toBe(200);
});
```

### Collection Documentation

Generate documentation from collections:

1. Right-click on collection
2. Select "**Generate Documentation**"
3. Choose format (Markdown, HTML)
4. Customize template
5. Export documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Collection Not Saving

**Problem:** Changes to collection not persisted

**Solutions:**
1. Check workspace permissions
2. Verify disk space
3. Check auto-save settings
4. Manually save with `Cmd/Ctrl + S`

### Import Failed

**Problem:** Cannot import collection

**Solutions:**
1. Verify file format
2. Check file is not corrupted

### Git Sync Issues

**Problem:** Collection changes not syncing

**Solutions:**
1. Check Git connection
2. Verify no conflicts
3. Manually trigger sync
4. Check Git credentials

### Missing Requests

**Problem:** Requests disappeared from collection

**Solutions:**
1. Check if accidentally moved to another folder
2. Check trash/deleted items
3. Restore from Git history
4. Check workspace is correct
