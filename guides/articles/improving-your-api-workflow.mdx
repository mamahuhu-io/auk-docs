Auk provides you with a minimal and blazing platform to design, develop and test your APIs. Auk enables you to quickly get started and even helps you to organize your work to help you improve your workflow.

Auk provides you with three major ways for you to manage your APIs and enhance your development workflow:

- Collections
- Environments
- Workspaces

## Collections

Collections help you save and organize your API requests. You can create collections and add requests to them to share with your team or to use later. You can also import and export collections from Auk, OpenAPI, and Postman.

## Environments

Environments provide you the functionality to create key-value pairs that can be used as variables in your request URL, headers, and even as auth tokens. You can create several such key-value pairs and group them under a single environment. Environments are self-isolated from each other and an active environment needs to be selected if you have multiple environments created.

## Workspaces

Workspaces help you organize your requests, collections, and environments for specific purposes and project stages. In the local-first edition you can create unlimited workspaces; data stays on your machine unless you link a Git remote.

To collaborate, connect the workspace to a Git repository and share through commits and pull requests—no cloud invites required.

To learn more about setting up new workspaces and collaborating via Git, head over to our [documentation for Workspaces](/documentation/features/workspaces).
