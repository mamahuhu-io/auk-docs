## Why Migrate to Auk?

Auk is based on Auk but focuses on local-first architecture:

| Feature | Auk Cloud | Auk |
|---------|------------------|-----|
| **Storage** | Cloud database | Local files |
| **Backend** | Required | Not required |
| **Authentication** | OAuth login | No login needed |
| **Collaboration** | Cloud workspaces | Git repositories |
| **Offline** | Limited | Full support |
| **Cost** | Free tier + paid | Free |
| **Data Control** | Cloud service | You control |
| **Self-host** | Complex setup | Desktop app only |

## Migration Overview

The migration process involves:

1. Export collections from Auk
2. Export environments from Auk
3. Import into Auk workspace
4. Configure Git sync for collaboration
5. Verify and test

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes per workspace

## Step 1: Export from Auk Cloud

### Export Collections

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to legacy Auk cloud (if applicable)">
    Open your previous cloud instance (e.g., your team's hosted Auk cloud) and log in.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Workspace">
    Switch to the workspace you want to export
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export Collections">
    1. Click on "Collections" in sidebar
    2. Click the three dots (...) menu
    3. Select "Export"
    4. Choose "Auk Collection (JSON)"
    5. Save the file
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repeat for Each Workspace">
    If you have multiple workspaces, export each separately
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Export Environments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Environments">
    Click "Environments" in Auk sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export Each Environment">
    1. Click on environment name
    2. Click the three dots (...) menu
    3. Select "Export"
    4. Save the JSON file
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export Global Environment">
    Don't forget to export the global environment if you use it
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Auk Cloud may have both personal and team workspaces. Export each separately.
</Note>

## Step 2: Create Auk Workspace

### Setup Workspace

1. Launch Auk
2. Create a new workspace
3. Choose storage location
4. Name it after your Auk workspace

### Workspace Mapping

Map Auk workspaces to Auk workspaces:

**Auk:**
```
- Personal Workspace
- Team A Workspace
- Team B Workspace
```

**Auk:**
```
- Personal (local workspace)
- Team-A (Git-synced workspace)
- Team-B (Git-synced workspace)
```

## Step 3: Import Collections

### Import Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Import Dialog">
    1. Click "Collections" in Auk sidebar
    2. Click "Import" button
    3. Select "Auk" as import type
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Export File">
    Choose the Auk collection JSON file
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Import">
    **Import Options:**
    - **Destination:** Choose target folder
    - **Conflict Resolution:**
      - Replace existing

  </Step>

  <Step title="Import">
    Click "Import" and wait for completion
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify">
    Review imported collections and test requests
  </Step>
</Steps>

- ❌ Cloud sync settings (use Git sync)

## Step 4: Import Environments

### Import Environment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Import Dialog">
    1. Click "Environments" in Auk sidebar
    2. Click "Import" button
    3. Select "Auk" as import type
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select File">
    Choose the Auk environment JSON file
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import">
    Click "Import" to complete
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Secret Values">
    1. Open imported environment
    2. Find secret variables
    3. Enter actual secret values
    4. Mark as "Secret" in Auk
    5. Save environment
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Environment Types

Auk environments map to Auk as follows:

| Auk | Auk |
|------------|-----|
| Global Environment | Global Environment |
| Personal Environment | Workspace Environment |
| Team Environment | Workspace Environment (Git-synced) |

## Step 5: Configure Git Sync

For team collaboration, set up Git sync:

### Create Git Repository

1. Create repository on GitHub/GitLab
2. Initialize with README
3. Keep it private for team data

### Configure in Auk

1. Open workspace settings
2. Enable Git sync
3. Enter repository URL
4. Configure authentication
5. Initial push

[Detailed Git setup guide](/documentation/getting-started/git-setup)

### Share with Team

1. Share repository URL with team
2. Team members create Auk workspace
3. Configure same Git repository
4. Pull to get collections
5. Set their own secret values

## Step 6: Verify Migration

### Check Collections

**Verify Structure:**
- [ ] All collections imported
- [ ] Folder hierarchy preserved
- [ ] Request names correct
- [ ] Request types correct (REST/GraphQL/WebSocket)

**Verify Requests:**
- [ ] URLs correct
- [ ] HTTP methods correct
- [ ] Headers present
- [ ] Bodies intact
- [ ] Authentication configured
- [ ] Scripts working

### Check Environments

**Verify Variables:**
- [ ] All variables imported
- [ ] Variable names correct
- [ ] Values correct
- [ ] Secret variables marked

**Test Variables:**
- [ ] Variables resolve in requests
- [ ] Environment switching works
- [ ] Variable precedence correct

### Test Functionality

1. Send REST requests
2. Test GraphQL queries
3. Test WebSocket connections
4. Verify authentication
5. Test scripts
6. Check variable substitution

## Feature Mapping

### Auk → Auk Features

| Auk Feature | Auk Equivalent | Notes |
|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| **Personal Workspace** | Workspace | Local storage |
| **Team Workspace** | Workspace + Git | Git-based collaboration |
| **Collections** | Collections | Same functionality |
| **Environments** | Environments | Same functionality |
| **Variables** | Variables | Same syntax `<<var>>` |
| **Pre-request Scripts** | Pre-request Scripts | Same API |
| **Tests** | Test Scripts | Same API |
| **History** | History | Local only |
| **Cloud Sync** | Git Sync | Git-based |
| **Team Members** | Git Collaborators | Via Git repository |
| **Roles** | Git Permissions | Via Git repository |

### Variable Syntax

Both use the same syntax:

```
<<baseUrl>>/<<apiVersion>>/users
```

No conversion needed!

### Script API

Auk and Auk use the same script API:

```javascript
// Both work the same
pw.env.set("token", "value");
pw.test("Status is 200", () => {
  pw.expect(pw.response.status).toBe(200);
});
```

## Differences to Note

### Team Collaboration

**Auk Cloud:**
- Real-time sync
- User roles (Owner, Editor, Viewer)
- Invite by email
- Cloud-based

**Auk:**
- Git-based sync (periodic)
- Git permissions (Read, Write, Admin)
- Share repository URL
- Local-first

### Authentication

**Auk Cloud:**
- Requires login (Google, GitHub, Email)
- User accounts
- Team management

**Auk:**
- No login required
- No user accounts
- Git-based team management

### Data Storage

**Auk Cloud:**
- Stored in Firebase/PostgreSQL
- Accessible from any device
- Requires internet

**Auk:**
- Stored locally
- Accessible offline
- Sync via Git when needed

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Collections Not Importing

**Problem:** Import fails with error

**Solutions:**
1. Verify JSON file is valid
2. Check file is Auk format
3. Try exporting again
4. Check file size
5. Import collections individually

### Issue: Team Workspace Data

**Problem:** Cannot export team workspace

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you have Owner/Editor role
2. Export from team workspace view
3. Contact workspace owner
4. Export individual collections

### Issue: History Not Imported

**Problem:** Request history missing

**Solutions:**
- History is not exported by Auk
- History stays local in Auk
- Start fresh history in Auk
- Old history remains in Auk

### Issue: Real-time Sync

**Problem:** Changes not appearing immediately for team

**Solutions:**
- Auk uses Git sync (periodic, not real-time)
- Configure shorter sync interval
- Manually trigger sync
- Communicate major changes to team

### Issue: User Roles

**Problem:** Cannot set user roles like in Auk

**Solutions:**
- Use Git repository permissions
- GitHub/GitLab have role systems
- Read, Write, Admin permissions
- Configure in Git service
