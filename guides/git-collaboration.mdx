## Team Collaboration with Git

Auk uses Git for team collaboration, providing version control, conflict resolution, and distributed workflows.

## Team Setup

### Initial Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Shared Repository">
    One team member creates a Git repository:
    ```bash
    # On GitHub/GitLab
    # Create new repository: team-api-collections
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push Initial Data">
    Push existing collections to repository:
    ```bash
    # In Auk workspace settings
    # Enable Git Sync
    # Enter repository URL
    # Initial push happens automatically
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Team Members Clone">
    Other team members clone the repository:
    ```bash
    # In Auk
    # Create New Workspace → Clone from Git
    # Enter repository URL
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Sync">
    Each team member configures auto-sync:
    ```json
    {
      "git": {
        "autoSync": true,
        "syncInterval": 900
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Collaboration Patterns

### Small Team (2-5 people)

**Strategy:** Single branch, frequent syncing

```json
{
  "git": {
    "autoSync": true,
    "syncInterval": 300,
    "conflictResolution": "smartMerge"
  }
}
```

**Best practices:**
- Sync every 5-15 minutes
- Communicate before major changes
- Use smart merge for conflicts
- Keep collections organized

### Large Team (5+ people)

**Strategy:** Feature branches, code review

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/payment-api

# Work on changes
# ...

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/payment-api

# Create pull request for review
```

**Best practices:**
- Use feature branches
- Require pull request reviews
- Assign collection ownership
- Document changes

## Avoiding Conflicts

### Communication

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Announce Major Changes">
    Before making significant changes:
    - Notify team in chat
    - Create feature branch
    - Coordinate timing
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Assign Ownership">
    Divide collections by ownership:
    ```
    collections/
    ├── auth/           # Alice owns
    ├── users/          # Bob owns
    └── payments/       # Carol owns
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sync Frequently">
    Reduce conflicts by syncing often:
    - Pull before starting work
    - Push after completing features
    - Sync before meetings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Division of Work

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="By Feature">
    ```
    collections/
    ├── authentication/
    ├── user-management/
    └── payment-processing/
    ```
    Each team member owns a feature area
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="By Service">
    ```
    collections/
    ├── backend-api/
    ├── frontend-api/
    └── mobile-api/
    ```
    Each team member owns a service
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="By Environment">
    ```
    workspaces/
    ├── development/
    ├── staging/
    └── production/
    ```
    Different team members manage different environments
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Workflow Examples

### Feature Development

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Branch">
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-endpoints
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Develop Feature">
    Add new endpoints and test them in Auk
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit Changes">
    Changes auto-committed by Auk
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push and Review">
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/new-endpoints
    # Create pull request on GitHub/GitLab
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Merge">
    After review, merge to main branch
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Hotfix Workflow

For urgent fixes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Hotfix Branch">
    ```bash
    git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fix Issue">
    Make necessary changes in Auk
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
    Verify fix works correctly
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fast-Track Merge">
    ```bash
    git push origin hotfix/critical-bug
    # Quick review and merge
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Checklist

Before creating PR:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Collections are organized
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] No sensitive data committed
- [ ] Descriptive commit messages

### Review Guidelines

When reviewing:

- Check request organization
- Verify environment variables
- Test endpoints if possible
- Look for sensitive data
- Provide constructive feedback

## Team Communication

### Daily Standup

Share during standup:
- What collections you're working on
- Any conflicts encountered
- Planned major changes
- Sync status

### Documentation

Maintain team documentation:

```markdown
# Team API Collections

## Current Work
- Alice: Authentication endpoints
- Bob: User management
- Carol: Payment processing

## Conventions
- Use `{{baseUrl}}` for all endpoints
- Mark secrets as secret variables
- Sync before end of day

## Contacts
- Questions: #api-testing channel
- Issues: GitHub Issues
```

## Handling Conflicts

### Prevention

- Sync frequently (every 5-15 min)
- Communicate before major changes
- Use feature branches
- Assign clear ownership

### Resolution

When conflicts occur:

1. **Don't Panic** - Conflicts are normal
2. **Review Changes** - Understand both versions
3. **Choose Strategy** - Smart merge, keep local, or use remote
4. **Test Result** - Verify merged version works
5. **Communicate** - Inform team of resolution

See [Conflict Resolution](/documentation/git-sync/conflict-resolution) for details.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sync Before Meetings">
    Always sync before team meetings:
    - Ensures everyone has latest changes
    - Reduces meeting time spent on sync issues
    - Shows current state of work
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Commits">
    Auk generates commit messages, but you can customize:
    ```json
    {
      "git": {
        "commitMessageTemplate": "[{{collection}}] {{description}}"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Regular Cleanup">
    Keep repository clean:
    - Delete merged branches
    - Archive old collections
    - Remove unused environments
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Backup Strategy">
    Multiple backups:
    - Git remote (primary)
    - Local backups (secondary)
    - External drive (tertiary)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Frequent conflicts">
    **Solutions:**
    - Reduce sync interval
    - Better communication
    - Split collections by ownership
    - Use feature branches
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sync takes too long">
    **Solutions:**
    - Split large collections
    - Increase sync interval
    - Use shallow clone
    - Check network speed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Team member can't sync">
    **Solutions:**
    - Verify Git credentials
    - Check repository access
    - Test SSH/HTTPS connection
    - Review sync logs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
